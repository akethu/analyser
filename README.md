# Analyser

A customisable keyword locater.

## Objective

This code allows a user to evaluate a document faster. By  noting down certain keywords, the program allows us to find sentences around, and including, the keywords mentioned by the user. The code gives an output with the following format:<br>
`Contains <keyword name>:`<br>
`<Sentences before the keyword>`<br>
`<Sentence containing the keyword>`<br>
`<Sentences after the keyword>`<br>

## Get started

1. Download the code.
2. Open it in a suitable IDE.
3. Go to line 75, and change the path of the file.
4. If a line is headed with the comment `Can be customised`, then you can change it (without affecting the functionality of the program) based on the instructions (given as comments).
